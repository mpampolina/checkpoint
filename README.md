# Checkpoint
Checkpoint is a fully-functional lightweight bookmarking web application. The motivation behind building Checkpoint was to create a link-saving tool with the simplicity of Chrome bookmarks but in the form factor of an easy-to-use and accessible web application. Checkpoint can be used to collect links to your favorite sites, webpages, and articles. Links are categorized into collections called boards based on a named topic of interest like cooking, self-development, or programming. Users can create, read, update, and delete their boards. The application features a responsive design, board filtering, and user authentication.
